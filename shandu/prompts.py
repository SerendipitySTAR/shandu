4.  **Tone and Style:** Is the tone (e.g., academic, business-like) and writing style consistent across all sections?
5.  **Completeness and Depth:** Does the report adequately address the main research query? Are there any obvious gaps in information or analysis? Does it meet the expected depth for its purpose?
6.  **Redundancy:** Are there any parts of the report that are unnecessarily repetitive? Can any sections be merged or condensed?
7.  **Clarity and Precision:** Is the language clear, precise, and unambiguous?

    "standard": "This report should be comprehensive, well-structured, and objective, written in clear language suitable for a general, educated audience. It must ensure a logical flow with an introduction, a body organized by clear headings and subheadings, and a conclusion. Prioritize clarity, factual accuracy, and a neutral presentation of information. While detailed, avoid overly technical jargon unless essential and well-explained. The aim is to inform thoroughly and accessibly.",
    "academic": "This report must strictly adhere to high academic standards, targeting an audience of peers and experts in the field. It requires a formal tone, precise domain-specific terminology, and a rigorous, logical structure, typically including: **Abstract** (concise summary of entire paper), **Introduction** (background, problem statement, research question/hypotheses, thesis statement, and overview of structure), **Literature Review** (critical synthesis of relevant existing scholarly work), **Methodology** (detailed description of research design, data collection, and analysis methods, if applicable, or the theoretical/analytical framework used), **Findings/Results** (objective presentation of results), **Discussion** (interpretation of findings, linking back to literature, addressing limitations, implications for theory and practice), and **Conclusion** (summary of main points, restatement of thesis, and contribution to knowledge), followed by a comprehensive **References** list (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago style). Argumentation must be evidence-based, critical, and demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter.",
    "business": "This report is for a business audience (e.g., executives, managers, clients) and must prioritize actionable insights, data-driven recommendations, and executive presence. It must begin with an **Executive Summary** that concisely presents the key findings, main conclusions, and core recommendations. The body should focus on addressing a specific business problem or opportunity, including relevant analysis (e.g., market analysis, financial projections, SWOT, competitive landscape) and clearly justified, specific, and measurable recommendations. Language must be clear, direct, concise, and professional, avoiding academic jargon. Professional formatting, including the effective use of headings, bullet points, charts, graphs, and tables to present data and highlight key information, is highly encouraged. The report should facilitate decision-making.",
    "literature_review": "This report is *exclusively* a critical synthesis and evaluation of existing scholarly literature on a defined topic; it does *not* involve presenting original empirical research. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, identifying key themes, significant debates, established theories, common methodologies, and important findings within the body of published work. It must critically assess the strengths, weaknesses, and contributions of the reviewed literature, explicitly identify gaps, inconsistencies, or unresolved controversies, and suggest directions for future research. A typical structure includes: **Introduction** (defining the topic, scope, and objectives of the review, outlining the search strategy), **Thematic Sections** (organizing and discussing the literature by key concepts, theories, or chronological developments, and synthesizing the findings), a **Critical Evaluation/Discussion** (highlighting overall patterns, methodological issues, gaps, and areas of contention in the literature), and a **Conclusion** (summarizing the main insights from the review and reiterating suggestions for future research). A comprehensive list of **References** is essential."

2.  **论点一致性：** 整份报告中提出的论点、主张和数据是否一致？是否存在任何矛盾或未经证实的说法？
3.  **主题完整性：** 报告是否始终围绕主要研究问题：“{{original_query}}”展开？中心主题是否在所有章节中都得到了充分的阐述和保持？
4.  **语气和风格：** 所有章节的语气（例如，学术性、商业性）和写作风格是否一致？
5.  **完整性和深度：** 报告是否充分地探讨了主要研究问题？是否存在任何明显的信息或分析空白？报告是否达到了其预期目的应有的深度？
6.  **冗余性：** 报告中是否存在不必要的重复部分？是否有任何章节可以合并或精简？
7.  **清晰度和精确性：** 语言是否清晰、精确且没有歧义？

请以简洁的列表形式提供具体的、可操作的改进建议，并为每条建议编号。
如果您未发现重大问题，请说明报告总体上一致且结构良好，但如果适用，仍可提供次要建议。
请关注高层次的结构和内容一致性问题，而非次要的语法错误，除非这些错误严重影响清晰度。"""
